# MyReads Project

This is the an app including a page of shleves representing three sections, currently reading, want to read and read where you can categorize any book according to your status.

Along with it is a search page where you can search for a new book to add to any of the sections available, with many categories to pick from.

## How to start the app:

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

There is a magic trick where while using the search input, using less than two letter words would not give you the correct state of the shelves on the search page.
